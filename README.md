## Description:
Here I created a basic employee tracking site. The user is prompted with questions on viewing the database, adding new employees, and updating existing employeesâ€™ files. Once the user is selected their choice, they will then be promoted with questions to update the file or add a new employee. 

## Technologies Used:
- Inquirer
- SQL
- Console Table

## Things we learned:
- I learned how to add SQL into a node file. I was still unable to get this application to function properly when it came to asking the questions. You can see the information from the table but it will not lead to the questions. I also struggled with repition of the choices.
