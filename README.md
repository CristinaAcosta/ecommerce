## Description:

Here I created a basic back end retail site. The user is able to get catergories, products and tags. You can use the ID to locate an item, to update an item, or to delete an item.

## Technologies Used:

- API
- SQL
- Insomnia
- Sequelize

## Things we learned:

- I learned how to better use Insomnia and how to use SQL more effeciently. I also learned how to use API's and how to integrate all the servers. I struggled with getting a lot of the post commands to work.
